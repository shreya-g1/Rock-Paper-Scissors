# Rock-Paper-Scissors
```
Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors! 
>You will be playing against the computer in a series of rounds. 
>In each round, you must randomly select from the 3 objects and TYPE THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER. 
  The computer will do the same. 
>Depending on the object that you and the computer chose, you will either win, lose, or the round 
  will be a draw. 
>The 3 objects are ROCK(1), PAPER(2), and SCISSORS(3). 
>The relationship between the objects is that: ROCK BEATS SCISSORS,  PAPER BEATS ROCK, and 
  SCISSORS BEAT PAPER. If both you and the computer chose the same object, it is a draw. 
>If you chose to end the game, you may exit(4). In the end, the total number of wins from both 
  players will be summed to determine the ultimate winner.
